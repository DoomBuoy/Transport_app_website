                                <li><strong>Why we need it:</strong> We use this data strictly to provide core functionality, such as finding your current location to calculate transit routes, showing nearby transport stops, and calculating distances to points of interest.</li>
                                <li><strong>How it is handled:</strong> Your location data is processed in real-time and transmitted securely to third-party routing and mapping APIs (Transport for NSW, TomTom) to fetch transit directions.</li>
